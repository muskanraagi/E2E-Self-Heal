Automatically repair broken Playwright E2E tests. When a UI change renames or restructures
an element and a test's selector breaks, the engine diagnoses the failure, patches the
broken selector/wait, **verifies the new selector against the live DOM**, then re-runs the
test until it passes (or a retry cap is hit) and writes the fix back — as a local **CLI** or
a **CI GitHub Action** that opens a patch PR.

> **Scope guardrail:** the engine only fixes **failing locators and wait conditions**. It
> never touches assertions or test logic, and every patch stays human-reviewable.

## How it works

Four layers drive a LangGraph repair loop:

1. **CLI core** — the single entry point (`e2e-healer`); everything, including CI, calls it.
2. **Data Preprocessor** — abstracts the raw Playwright log and the `git diff` into compact,
   hallucination-resistant context (the failing selector + the DOM attribute that changed).
3. **LangGraph agent** — `Diagnoser → Patch Generator → Selector Verifier → Test Runner`,
   looping via a conditional Router until the test passes or `max_loops` is reached.
4. **Selector Verifier** — checks each patched selector against the real page DOM so it
   resolves to **exactly one** element (Node/Playwright helper). Hallucinated (0 matches) or
   ambiguous (>1) selectors are reverted and re-patched _before_ a full test run.
5. **Test Runner** — runs `npx playwright test` via subprocess to validate each attempt.

                                            │ pass or loop cap
                                            ▼
                                          [End]
```

> The Selector Verifier **skips** gracefully (loop proceeds unverified) when
> `E2E_HEALER_APP_URL` is empty or the page is unreachable (e.g. Node/Playwright not
> installed) — tooling problems never block a heal.

## Usage (CI / GitHub Action)

The flagship workflow: run your suite and auto-heal on failure, opening a patch PR for review:

```yaml
- name: E2E self-heal
  id: heal
  uses: Lee-Dongwook/E2E-Self-Heal@v0.2.0
  with:
    test-path: tests/example.spec.ts
    nvidia-api-key: ${{ secrets.NVIDIA_API_KEY }}
    diff-base: ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }}
    app-url: http://localhost:4173 # optional: enables live selector verification

- name: Open patch PR
  if: steps.heal.outputs.outcome == 'healed'
  uses: peter-evans/create-pull-request@v6
  with:
    body-path: ${{ steps.heal.outputs.summary-path }}
    branch: e2e-self-heal/${{ github.run_id }}
```

The action's `outcome` output is `passed` \| `healed` \| `unhealed`. For a Playwright suite
in a subdirectory, pass `working-directory:`. A **runnable self-demo** that heals this repo's
own `examples/` project lives in [`ci/github-workflow.example.yml`](ci/github-workflow.example.yml).

## Demo (verified end-to-end)

The [`examples/`](examples/) project reproduces a real break: the page's button id was
renamed `submit-btn` → `submit`, so `example.spec.ts` times out. Running the healer against
it (with a live NVIDIA key) produces:

```text
diagnoser_finished
patch_generator_finished        instruction_count=1
selector_verify_started         selector_count=1 url=http://localhost:4173
selector_verify_passed          counts={'#submit': 1}
test_runner_passed              loop_count=0
fixed after 0 loop(s)
```

```diff
- await page.click("#submit-btn");
+ await page.click("#submit");        # assertion on "Thanks!" left untouched
```

Reproduce it yourself: see [`examples/README.md`](examples/README.md).

## In practice

A real run against a landing-page CTA test. A UI refactor renamed the button id
`#enter-demo-btn` → `#demo-cta-btn`, so `demo-cta.spec.ts` started failing on
`locator.click`. Pointed at the file, the engine diagnosed the break against the `git diff`,
patched **only the broken selector** (leaving the `toHaveURL` assertion untouched), re-ran
the suite, and passed on the first attempt — end to end on NVIDIA NIM
(`integrate.api.nvidia.com`, `openai/gpt-oss-120b`):

## Install

Requires Python 3.13+ and a Playwright project (Node) in your repo.

**Recommended — one-line global install:**

```bash
pipx install ai-driven-e2e
# or, before PyPI release:
uv tool install git+https://github.com/Lee-Dongwook/E2E-Self-Heal.git
```

Then in any Playwright project:

```bash
cp .env.example .env    # set E2E_HEALER_NVIDIA_API_KEY
e2e-healer tests/login.spec.ts
```

Get a free NVIDIA NIM API key at [build.nvidia.com](https://build.nvidia.com/) (default
model `openai/gpt-oss-120b`).

<details>
<summary>Development install from a local clone</summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lee-Dongwook/E2E-Self-Heal.git
cd E2E-Self-Heal
uv sync --extra dev
uv tool install --force .    # global `e2e-healer` from this checkout
```

Re-run `uv tool install --force .` after pulling changes.

</details>

## Usage (CLI)

```bash
# Heal the WHOLE suite — run every test, then repair each failing file (aggregate summary):
uv run e2e-healer

# Heal a single failing test (with no --log, the tool runs it to capture the failure):
uv run e2e-healer tests/example.spec.ts

# Preview only — run the loop but write nothing:
uv run e2e-healer tests/example.spec.ts --dry-run

# Feed a pre-captured log and a PR-scoped diff (the CI path):
uv run e2e-healer tests/example.spec.ts --log playwright.log --diff-base origin/main --json

# Enable live-DOM selector verification against a running app:
uv run e2e-healer tests/example.spec.ts --app-url http://localhost:4173
```

Exit code is `0` when the test is healed, non-zero otherwise. `--json` prints a
machine-readable `RepairSummary` to stdout (human output goes to stderr) so CI can branch
on it.

## Configuration

All settings use the `E2E_HEALER_` prefix (see [`.env.example`](.env.example)):

> The `--app-url` CLI flag overrides `E2E_HEALER_APP_URL`. To actually run selector
> verification locally, the Playwright project needs browsers installed
> (`npm install && npx playwright install`).

## Limitations

- Fixes selectors and waits only — never assertions or control flow.
- The JSX/TSX diff analyzer is a regex heuristic in v0.1 (tree-sitter upgrade planned).
- The Selector Verifier checks the **entry-page state** at `APP_URL` in v1. Elements that
  only appear after clicks/navigation aren't verified here; the Test Runner remains the final
  arbiter (failure-time snapshot capture is planned).
- Healing quality depends on the LLM and the clarity of the `git diff`.
