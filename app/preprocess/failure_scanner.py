"""Scan a whole-suite Playwright log for the distinct test files that failed.

Playwright's reporter lists each failure as a numbered entry, optionally prefixed with a
project tag, e.g.::

    1) [chromium] › tests/login.spec.ts:12:3 › user can log in
    2) example.spec.ts:7:5 › submits the form

We extract the failing test-file paths (deduplicated, in first-seen order) so the suite
healer can repair each one.
